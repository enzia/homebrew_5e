### Blood Curse of Wretched Ailment
___
You can use a bonus action to temporarily inebriate nearby foes, causing them to wretch. Each creature of Medium size or smaller of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature falls prone and becomes poisoned until the start of your next turn. A creature is immune to this curse if it has immunity to the poisoned condition.

_**Amplify**_ The curse can affect a creature regardless of its size, and a creature that fails its saving throw takes additional poison damage equal to two rolls of your hemocraft die.

### Blood Curse of Rapid Lethargy
___
You can use a bonus action to afflict a creature you can see within 90 feet of you with a sudden
onset of drowsiness. You cast the _sleep_ spell, requiring no components, but targeting
only that creature.

_**Amplify.**_ You can target an additional creature you can see within 20 feet of the first target
when casting _sleep_. When casting _sleep_ this way, you do not subtract from the total rolled for for each of its targets.

### Blood Curse of Instilled Doubt
___
When a creature within 30 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use
your reaction to temporarily instill doubt within the creature's mind, causing its
attacks to have disadvantage until the end of its next turn. A creature is immune
to this curse if it has immunity to psychic damage.

_**Amplify.**_ The creature takes psychic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die each time it misses with an attack.

### Blood Curse of Stolen Fate
___
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage. You have advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make until the end of your next turn.

_**Amplify.**_ The target subtracts one roll of your hemocraft die from its roll.

### Blood Curse of Open Wounds
___
You can use a bonus action to inflict further suffering upon a creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is missing any of its hit points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it has fewer than half of its hit points remaining, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. The target takes necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your hemocraft die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

_**Amplify.**_ The curse lasts for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.
